I like to *primarily* code in **Python** language.
I have made some projects like ***Stock Image Site***, ***Social Media Platform for Artists***, ***Infinite Quiz App*** and wrote scripts for *automating* stuff like *Getting Proxy list* from a proxy site and for *Searching files in a Computer* in **Python** Language. Besides coding, I also like to *produce music* in **FL Studio** whenever i get time to.
